 What is Git?
Git is a tool that records changes to your files, so you can:

Go back to an older version if something breaks

See who changed what and when

Collaborate with others without messing up each other's code

Think of it like a "time machine" for your code.

💡 Why Do You Need Git as a Software Developer?
Reason	Explanation
✅ Version Control	Save different versions of your code and go back anytime
👥 Collaboration	Work on the same project with teammates, without overwriting each other
🚫 Undo Mistakes	Revert changes if you break something
🔄 Track History	See what was changed, when, and by whom
☁️ Remote Backup	Store your code safely online (e.g. on GitHub)
📂 Branching	Try new features without affecting the main version of your project

📦 Where Git Is Used
Most developers use Git with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket — platforms where you can store and share your Git projects online.

🧑‍💻 Example:
You start building a website. Every time you make progress, you save your changes using Git:

bash
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
git add .
git commit -m "Add homepage layout"
git push
Now, your code is saved, versioned, and backed up online.

✅ Summary
Git helps you keep your code safe, organized, and easy to work on — alone or in a team.

Every professional developer uses it.

It’s essential if you want to work on real-world projects.
